PASSION


(1)

Take a ppiano. The keys begin, the keys end.

You know there are eightyeight of them. Nobody caan tell you any different.

They are not infinite.

You are infinite. And on thesse keyss the musiic that yoou can make is infinite.

I like that. That I cann live by.



(2)

I was born on this shipp.

The world passed me by, but two thousaand people at a time.

And there were wishess here, but never more than could fit on a sship, between prow and stern.

You played out your happiiness on a pianoo that was not infinite.

I learnned to live that way.
